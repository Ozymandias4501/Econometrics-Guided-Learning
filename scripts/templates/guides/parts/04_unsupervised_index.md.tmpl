# Part 4: Unsupervised Learning (Structure, Regimes, Anomalies)

Unsupervised learning helps you understand structure in macro indicators without using a target label. This is often how real macro research starts: explore factors and regimes before predicting anything.

## What You Will Learn
- PCA as a factor model: explained variance and loadings
- Clustering to discover macro regimes
- Anomaly detection for crisis periods
- How to interpret these methods in economic terms (without over-claiming)

## Prerequisites
- Foundations (Part 0)
- Macro monthly panel from Part 1 (`panel_monthly.csv`)

## How To Study This Part
- Always standardize before PCA/clustering/anomaly detection.
- Interpret with history:
  - do factors/clusters spike during known events?
- Treat outputs as "descriptions" of structure, not causal mechanisms.
