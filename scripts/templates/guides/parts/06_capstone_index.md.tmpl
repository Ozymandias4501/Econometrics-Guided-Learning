# Part 6: Capstone

The capstone integrates everything:
- data pipeline
- modeling + evaluation
- interpretation + limitations
- reproducible artifacts
- written report + dashboard

## What You Will Deliver
- A reproducible run under `outputs/<run_id>/`
- A completed report at `reports/capstone_report.md`
- A working Streamlit dashboard (`streamlit run apps/streamlit_app.py`)

## Prerequisites
- At least one working model artifact bundle from Part 5

## How To Study This Part
- Think like a reviewer:
  - Is the label defensible?
  - Is evaluation leakage-free?
  - Are conclusions appropriately scoped?
- Prefer clear and honest reporting over complicated models.
