# Part 1: Data (Macro + Micro)

This part builds the datasets that every later notebook relies on. If you get the data timing wrong, the model results can look impressive but be meaningless.

## What You Will Learn
- How to call real APIs (FRED + Census/ACS) and cache results
- How to align mixed-frequency time series (daily/monthly/quarterly)
- How to compute GDP growth rates and construct a technical recession label
- How to build clean, typed, analysis-ready tables

## Prerequisites
- Foundations (Part 0)
- Comfort reading pandas code (`read_csv`, `resample`, `merge`)

## How To Study This Part
- Treat this as data engineering practice.
- For every transformation, ask: "Could this accidentally use future information?"
- Keep a small "data dictionary" in your notes: what each column means and its units.
