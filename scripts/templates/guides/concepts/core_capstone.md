### Core Capstone: How To Produce a High-Quality Final Project

A strong capstone is not just a model. It is a full argument:
- what is the task?
- what is the label and why is it defensible?
- what data is available when?
- how did you evaluate without leakage?
- what do results mean and what are limitations?

Write like a reviewer is reading.
