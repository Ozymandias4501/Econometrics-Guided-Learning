### Core Unsupervised Learning: Describe Structure Before Predicting

Unsupervised methods help you understand structure in the indicators.
They do not require a target label.

#### Standardization matters
Many unsupervised methods rely on distances or variances.
If one variable has larger units, it dominates.

> **Definition:** **Standardization** rescales each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

#### Interpretation stance
Treat unsupervised outputs as:
- descriptions (factors, regimes, anomalies)
- hypotheses you can investigate

Avoid treating them as causal explanations.
