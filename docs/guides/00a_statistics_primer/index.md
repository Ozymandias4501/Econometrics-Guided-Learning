# Part 0: Statistics Primer

This part builds the statistical vocabulary and intuition that every later module depends on.

## What You Will Learn
- How to summarize and visualize data (descriptive statistics)
- The probability distributions that underlie every hypothesis test
- Why sample statistics work (CLT) and how to quantify uncertainty (CIs)
- The logic of hypothesis testing, p-values, and statistical power
- How to choose and apply the right statistical test
- The difference between correlation and causation
- Bayesian vs frequentist perspectives on probability

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python (variables, functions, loops)
- Basic pandas (DataFrame/Series)
- No prior statistics knowledge required — this is where we start

## How To Study This Part
- Work through notebooks in order (00 → 08); each builds on the previous.
- Read the notebook markdown first.
- Implement TODOs without looking at solutions.
- Use the guide when you do not understand *why* something is true.
- After finishing, write 3-5 sentences summarizing what you learned and what could go wrong in a real project.
