# Part 0: Foundations

This part builds the habits and vocabulary that prevent the most common mistakes in economic/statistical ML.

## What You Will Learn
- How time ordering changes evaluation (time splits vs random splits)
- What leakage is (and how to detect it)
- Core statistical concepts used later (correlation, bias/variance, overfitting, multicollinearity)

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python (variables, functions, loops)
- Basic pandas (DataFrame/Series)

If you are new to pandas time series, go slowly and copy small snippets into a scratch cell to experiment.

## How To Study This Part
- Read the notebook markdown first.
- Implement TODOs without looking at solutions.
- Use the guide when you do not understand *why* something is true.
- After finishing, write 3-5 sentences summarizing what you learned and what could go wrong in a real project.
