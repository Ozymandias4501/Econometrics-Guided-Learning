        "- building a county-year panel,\n",
        "- fixed effects (TWFE),\n",

        "- data/processed/census_county_panel.csv\n",

        "## Common Pitfalls\n",
        "- Running cells top-to-bottom without reading the instructions.\n",

        "## Quick Fixes (When You Get Stuck)\n",
        "- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, re-run the bootstrap cell and restart the kernel; make sure `PROJECT_ROOT` is the repo root.\n",
        "- If a `data/processed/*` file is missing, either run the matching build script (see guide) or use the notebook’s `data/sample/*` fallback.\n",
