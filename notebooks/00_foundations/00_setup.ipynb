        "- evaluating with the wrong split strategy,\n",

        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites (Quick Self-Check)\n",
        "- Comfort with basic Python + pandas (reading CSVs, making plots).\n",
        "- Willingness to write short interpretation notes as you go.\n",

        "## Quick Fixes (When You Get Stuck)\n",
        "- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, re-run the bootstrap cell and restart the kernel; make sure `PROJECT_ROOT` is the repo root.\n",
        "- If a `data/processed/*` file is missing, either run the matching build script (see guide) or use the notebook\u2019s `data/sample/*` fallback.\n",
