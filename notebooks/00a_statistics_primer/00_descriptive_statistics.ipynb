    "## Why This Notebook Matters\n",
    "Before fitting any model, you need to understand the shape and scale of your data.\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are the first line of defense against modeling mistakes:\n",
    "they reveal outliers, skewness, and data quality issues that can silently corrupt downstream results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites (Quick Self-Check)\n",
    "- Comfort with basic Python + pandas (reading CSVs, making plots).\n",
    "- No statistics background required \u2014 this is where we start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Produce\n",
    "- (no file output; learning/analysis notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "- You can compute and interpret mean, median, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.\n",
    "- You can create informative visualizations of univariate distributions.\n",
    "- You can articulate when the mean is misleading and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "- Confusing sample statistics with population parameters.\n",
    "- Ignoring skewness and assuming everything is symmetric.\n",
    "- Using `.describe()` without actually reading the output.\n",
    "- Forgetting to check for missing values before computing statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Fixes (When You Get Stuck)\n",
    "- If a column has unexpected NaNs, check `df.isna().sum()`.\n",
    "- If a histogram looks wrong, check your bin count and whether you need to drop outliers for visualization.\n",
    "- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, re-run the bootstrap cell.\n",

    "- Work section-by-section; don't skip the markdown.\n",
    "- Most code cells are incomplete on purpose: replace TODOs and `...`, then run.\n",
    "- After each section, write 2\u20134 sentences answering the interpretation prompts (what changed, why it matters).\n",
    "- Prefer `data/processed/*` if you have built the real datasets; otherwise use the bundled `data/sample/*` fallbacks.\n",
    "- Use the **Checkpoint (Self-Check)** section to catch mistakes early.\n",
    "- Use **Solutions (Reference)** only to unblock yourself; then re-implement without looking.\n",
    "- Use the matching guide (`docs/guides/00a_statistics_primer/00_descriptive_statistics.md`) for the math, assumptions, and deeper context.\n"
